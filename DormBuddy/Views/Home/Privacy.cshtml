    <p>This demo project is designed for demonstration purposes only and is not intended for real-world use. While we store usernames, emails, hashed passwords, tasks, and pseudo financial transactions in our database, <strong>no real payment processing</strong> or sensitive personal data is being collected or used.</p>

    <h4>Information We Collect</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Information:</strong> We collect usernames, email addresses, and hashed passwords for basic user account functionality.</li>

    </ul>

        <li>Simulating financial transactions within the demo environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Data Security</h4>

    <h4>Third-Party Sharing</h4>
    <p>We do not share any user data with third parties. All data is stored locally within the scope of this demo project.</p>
